# CNN_ml4cv

A collection of convolutional neural network (CNN) experiments for image classification. This repository includes:
- A simple scratch CNN (`simplemodel.py`)
- A pretrained model with a ResNet backbone (`pretrainedmodel.py`)
- Various experiment scripts (hyperparameter tuning, loss comparison, model comparison, etc.)
- Utility scripts for data loading and training
